Fundi-Fix is a web application that connects residents with local artisans (**fundis**) for household services. The platform allows users to easily find, book, and review tradespeople such as plumbers, electricians, and technicians.
The goal of this project is to create a **secure and user-friendly platform** for both:
-Residents seeking household services, and  
-Fundis(artisans) looking for work opportunities.
- Secure **user registration and login** for residents and fundis.
-2Factor Authentication (2FA) via email verification codes.
- Users can create, view, and update their own profiles.
- Fundis can **create and manage public profiles** showing their skills, rates, and locations.
- Basic booking feature for residents to initiate service requests with fundis.
